## Domain Context and Terminology
### Overall Purpose of the Problem Statement (Daily Work Perspective)

The overall purpose of the **On-Demand Service Scheduling and Fulfillment System** in daily work is to systematically manage and control how service requests are **scheduled, assigned, and executed** in a reliable and structured manner.

On a day-to-day basis, this problem statement guides the work toward:

- Converting informal service coordination into a well-defined workflow  
- Ensuring that service requests move smoothly from booking to completion  
- Reducing uncertainty, delays, and manual follow-ups  
- Providing operational clarity for both customers and service providers  

In essence, the purpose is to bring **predictability, accountability, and structure** to everyday service interactions that are otherwise fragmented and unreliable.

---

## What are the primary goals or outcomes of this problem statement?

### Primary Goals

### 1. Reliable On-Demand Service Scheduling

The primary goal is to enable customers to schedule services in a **predictable, time-bound, and system-enforced** manner.

Customers must be able to:
- Select a service  
- Choose a date and time slot  
- Receive confirmation without repeated follow-ups  

Scheduling eliminates:
- Uncertain availability  
- Verbal commitments  
- Delays caused by no-shows  

**Justification (Scheduling):**  
Scheduling transforms informal, unreliable service coordination into a **structured, time-guaranteed interaction** between customers and service providers.

---

### 2. End-to-End Service Fulfillment Assurance

The system ensures that every scheduled service is **actually delivered**, not just booked.

Fulfillment includes:
- Assigning an appropriate service provider  
- Ensuring the provider arrives at the scheduled time  
- Completing the service within the defined scope  

The platform tracks the entire service lifecycle:

Requested → Scheduled → Assigned → In-Progress → Completed


**Justification (Fulfillment):**  
Fulfillment bridges the gap between **booking a service and receiving the service**, ensuring real-world execution rather than just digital confirmation.

---

### 3. Reduction of Coordination Overhead for Customers

A key outcome is to remove the burden of:
- Calling multiple service contacts  
- Negotiating availability  
- Repeated follow-ups and uncertainty  

The platform acts as a **single point of resolution** for diverse household and small-business service needs.

---

### 4. Support for Both One-Time and Recurring Services

The system must support:
- One-time services (repairs, installations)  
- Recurring services (gardening, maintenance, cleaning)  

This ensures:
- Continuity of service  
- Fixed schedules  
- Reduced anxiety for customers during long-term needs (e.g., travel, daily upkeep)

---

### 5. Transparent Pricing and Service Scope

The system provides:
- Upfront pricing  
- Clearly defined service scope  

This removes:
- Last-minute bargaining  
- Disputes after service completion  

Transparency is essential for **trust and repeat usage**.

---

## Secondary Goals  
*(Supporting but not core to the problem statement)*

### 6. Improved Service Reliability Through Provider Structuring

Service providers are organized through **collectives** to:
- Ensure backup availability  
- Maintain accountability  

This indirectly improves fulfillment reliability for customers.

---

### 7. Stable Workflows for Service Providers

Structured scheduling enables:
- Predictable workloads  
- Stable income through recurring services  

Provider reliability directly enhances customer fulfillment success.

---

### 8. Quality Improvement Over Time

Feedback and collective learning allow:
- Upskilling of service providers  
- Improved service consistency  

This strengthens long-term platform trust.

## Rules, Constraints, and Exceptions

This section outlines the governing rules, limitations, and exception scenarios for the on-demand service marketplace domain, based on the domain expert discussion.

---

### Mandatory Rules or Policies

- Service providers **must only be assigned services that match their registered skills**.
- **Scheduling and provider assignment are fully system-driven** and handled by the fulfillment logic.
- Service providers **cannot accept or reject jobs** once availability is declared.
- **Provider ratings must influence job prioritization** when multiple eligible providers exist.
- The system **must incentivize good customer experience** through higher priority and better job allocation.
- **Recurring services must follow consistent scheduling rules** throughout their lifecycle.
- After successful payment, the system **must proceed with fulfillment automatically**.

---

### Constraints or Limitations

- Providers can only be scheduled **within their declared availability windows**.
- Scheduling logic must balance **skills, ratings, availability, and fairness**, limiting the use of simple algorithms.
- **Not all scenarios can be handled through automation**; some require human intervention.
- Manual admin management **does not scale** for large numbers of users or providers.
- Post-service processes such as warranties and refunds **fall outside core pre-delivery system scope**.

---

### Common Exceptions or Edge Cases

- **Provider No-Show**: Provider fails to arrive at the scheduled time.
- **Customer Cancellation**: Customer cancels after scheduling, potentially near service time.
- **Recurring Service Disruption**: Provider becomes unavailable during an active recurring plan.
- **Low-Rated Provider Assignment**: Assigned when no higher-rated provider is available.
- **Scheduling Conflicts**: Overlapping or invalid slots generated by system logic.
- **Customer–Provider Mismatch**: Reassignment required due to prior negative experience.

---

### Situations Where Things Usually Go Wrong

- **Complex scheduling edge cases**, especially involving recurring plans.
- **Dispute handling**, where service quality cannot be fully validated by system logic.
- **Over-dependence on admin intervention**, causing operational bottlenecks.
- **Poor incentive structures**, such as equal job distribution regardless of performance.
- **Improper handling of cancellations and no-shows**, reducing platform trust.

---

### Key Takeaway

> The domain functions best when **scheduling is automated**, **quality is rewarded**, and **exceptions are supported by human intervention**.

## Current Challenges and Pain Points

### What parts of this process are most difficult or inefficient?

From a high-level design perspective, the overall flow of an on-demand service platform is conceptually clear. However, both industry practices and domain expert input indicate that the **most difficult and inefficient part of the process is service scheduling**.

Key challenges include:
- Handling different types of services with varying durations and complexity
- Supporting multiple scheduling options such as one-time and recurring services
- Coordinating multiple services booked in a single order
- Aligning customer-selected time slots with service provider availability, skills, and location
- Preventing time conflicts and overlapping service assignments

Scheduling directly impacts service fulfillment and therefore becomes the most critical and sensitive component of the system.

---

### Where do delays, errors, or misunderstandings usually occur?

Delays and errors typically occur in areas where **logical scheduling decisions must align with real-world constraints**:

- Slot availability mismatches between customer selection and actual provider availability
- Delays in assigning the most suitable service provider after booking
- Complex bookings involving multiple services or recurring schedules
- Expectation mismatches when customers assume immediate service without understanding operational constraints
- Last-mile execution issues, such as provider delays or overbooked schedules

According to the domain expert, such issues rarely originate from user-facing design but instead stem from **backend scheduling and provider allocation logic**.

---

### What information is hardest to track or manage today?

The most difficult information to track and manage in real time includes:

- Accurate and up-to-date service provider availability windows
- Variability in actual service durations compared to estimated times
- Mapping the right skill sets to the correct service requirements
- Ensuring consistency and reliability in recurring service assignments
- Managing scheduling constraints such as buffer times, interval overlaps, and capacity limits

The domain expert highlighted that **managing these scheduling variables at scale** is the primary operational challenge, rather than the high-level system architecture itself.

---

### Key Insight

> While the high-level system design is straightforward, the real challenge lies in implementing a robust and flexible scheduling mechanism that can handle diverse services, time options, and provider constraints while ensuring reliable fulfillment.

## Assumptions & Clarifications

### 1. Assumptions Made by the Team and Confirmed

- **Separation of responsibilities across system components**  
  The assumption that the system can be logically divided into catalog, fulfillment (scheduling), delivery, and journey/orchestration layers was confirmed as an industry-aligned approach.

- **Fulfillment team owns scheduling logic**  
  Scheduling (slot allocation and provider assignment) is not part of catalog or checkout and is handled entirely by the fulfillment logic.

- **Skill-based provider assignment**  
  Services require specific skills, and providers must be matched based on those skills as a core industry principle.

- **Provider availability is time-based**  
  Providers declare availability windows, and the system schedules jobs strictly within those windows.

- **Ratings influence provider selection**  
  Higher-rated providers are preferred when multiple eligible providers are available for the same time slot.

- **Recurring services are valid and common**  
  Instant, one-time scheduled, and recurring (weekly/monthly) services are realistic and commonly used in production systems.

- **Automation-first system design**  
  Most scheduling, matching, and prioritization decisions are automated rather than manually controlled by admins.

---

### 2. Assumptions That Were Corrected

- **Providers can accept or reject jobs (Rapido-style model)**  
  *Corrected:* Providers do not accept or reject jobs. Once availability is declared, jobs are directly assigned by the system.

- **Equal job or income distribution among providers**  
  *Corrected:* Equal distribution removes incentives for quality. Provider differentiation (ratings, behavior, reliability) must influence assignment.

- **Admin manually manages users and providers**  
  *Corrected:* Users and providers manage their own profiles. Admin involvement is limited to exceptions or system-level failures.

- **All disputes can be handled by code**  
  *Corrected:* No-shows, disputes, and service conflicts often require human intervention and cannot be fully automated.

- **Round-robin scheduling is sufficient**  
  *Corrected:* Pure round-robin ignores service quality. A weighted approach considering ratings, recency, and availability is required.

---

### 3. Assumptions That Were Partially Validated / Clarified

- **Union / collective-based provider model**  
  Routing jobs through collectives or unions is feasible, but final assignment decisions should rest with the collective manager.

- **Weighted scheduling algorithms**  
  Exact algorithms were not specified, but scheduling must consider multiple weighted factors such as ratings, availability, fairness, and recency.

- **Admin role definition**  
  Admin roles exist conceptually but require clear boundaries; overloading admin responsibilities can hinder scalability.

---

### 4. Open Questions Requiring Follow-Up

- **Exact scheduling algorithm details**  
  What are the precise weights and decision rules among rating, distance, availability, recency, and fairness?

- **Legal and regulatory requirements**  
  Legal and compliance policies required for the platform were not discussed and need separate research.

- **Post-service processes**  
  Technical handling of warranties, refunds, and dispute resolution remains undefined.

- **Collective accountability model**  
  Rules for conflict handling, penalties, and quality enforcement within unions require further clarification.

- **Automation thresholds**  
  Criteria for automatically banning or restricting providers based on ratings or complaints need definition.
